# AI-based-voice-assistance-bot-using-Natural-Language-Processing
AI-based voice assistance bots are employed in a wide range of applications, 
including virtual personal assistants, smart home devices, customer support 
systems, and more. They offer convenient and intuitive interfaces for users to 
interact with technology, allowing them to access information, control devices, 
and perform tasks hands-free. In this project, we are building an AI based voice 
assistance for an educational institute . The objective is to create a voice-based virtual assistant that utilizes NLP 
techniques to interpret and process user queries accurately and provide relevant 
responses. The bot should be able to handle various types of questions, 
commands, and requests, and provide appropriate actions or information. The 
need for this voice assistant bot for college is to provide students with a 
convenient and efficient way to access information, perform tasks, and manage 
their academic life using natural language voice commands .
